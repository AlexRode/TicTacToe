# Tic Tac Toe with AI

This project is a Java implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, featuring an artificial intelligence (AI) opponent. Players have the option to play against another human or against an AI. There are two variants of AI: a "Dumb AI" that makes random moves, and an "Invincible AI" that utilizes the Minimax algorithm to ensure it never loses.

## Features

- Traditional Tic Tac Toe gameplay on a 3x3 board.
- Option to play against a human or AI opponent.
- Two AI variants: Dumb AI and Invincible AI.
